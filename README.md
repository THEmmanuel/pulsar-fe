## Key Features

### 1. Fixed-Price Token
- **Stability:** The PULSAR token maintains a fixed value, addressing volatility issues that hinder mainstream adoption.
- **Infinite Supply:** Tokens are minted as needed to facilitate seamless transactions within the platform, creating a reliable and scalable ecosystem.

### 2. User-Driven Marketplace
- **Flexible Trading:** Users can set their own token exchange rates within the platform while the official token price remains fixed.
- **Dynamic Economy:** Encourages organic price discovery and trading activity while maintaining system-wide stability.

### 3. Proprietary Encryption with Instinct Engine
- **Secure Transactions:** Utilizes AES-GCM and RSA encryption for robust data protection.
- **Key Pair Generation:** Ensures safe handling of cryptographic keys for end-to-end security.
- **Integration:** Provides a secure foundation for all platform operations.

### 4. Rewards and Incentives
- **Adoption Boost:** Periodic rewards (e.g., 50x or 100x token bonuses) incentivize early adoption and user engagement.
- **Controlled Cashout:** Rewards are tied to trading activity to ensure liquidity and sustainable growth.

## How It Works

### Token Ecosystem
1. **Buying Tokens:** Users purchase tokens via fiat or crypto payments. Transactions are automated, and tokens are deposited into user wallets.
2. **Marketplace Trading:** Users can trade tokens at custom rates with other users while leveraging the fixed price for stability.
3. **Rewards Balance:** Additional tokens earned through rewards are locked until trading activity unlocks them for use or withdrawal.

### Transaction Process
- **Step 1:** User buys PULSAR tokens for fiat or crypto.
- **Step 2:** Tokens are deposited into their wallet instantly.
- **Step 3:** Users can trade tokens or hold them for rewards and future transactions.
- **Step 4:** Platform earns a 5% transaction fee on all exchanges, ensuring a sustainable revenue model.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
